Iperquit allows users to quickly and easily obtain detailed information about the Internet route from their computer to various destinations. The primary goal of this tool is to determine if an Internet service provider is providing preferential treatment to certain destinations.

Iperquit is one of many tools designed to give ISP customers a clearer understanding of what they are getting for their hard earned money.

Iperquit consists of three pieces working together

  1. Iperquit Client - A client side Java application or applet which performs the tests.
  1. Iperquit Server - A server application run by those willing to donate bandwidth and computing resources. The Iperquit Server performs the same tests as the Iperquit Client, and acts as an endpoint for tests run by other clients and servers.
  1. Iperquit Web - A web application which gathers, analyses and displays the data collected by the Iperquit Client ans Server.

Iperquit is currently in a planning and very early development phase, if you would like to help out, please let me know. Any help would be appreciated, particularly in the web design and data analysis areas.
